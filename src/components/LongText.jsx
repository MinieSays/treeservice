          <b>Reducing Potential Hazards</b> Often, weaker or dead tree branches
          hang over your building or people. These branches are more likely to
          fall and break, especially during harsher weather conditions like wind
          or rain. By trimming trees, you are preventing injury to your pets,
          animals, and loved ones. Visually Appealing – Professional tree
          trimmers will possess an eye for trimming the tree based on its
          natural shape. It helps to increase the overall natural shape and
          structure of the tree. Arborists in Fort Collins know how to remove
          too-large or odd-shaped branches to create a balanced look that is
          appealing to on-goers.

          <b>Stump Grinding - </b>
          Our team of experts used a process of removal called stump grinding.
          This process begins by using a stump grinder machine to cut the stump
          into tiny wooden chips unless there is no visible stump, grinding the
          stump to ground level. Usually to the depth of 6-12 inches. Your yard
          is good to go after thoroughly cleaning the wood chips and the area!
          Tree stumps are a safety hazard and can be seen as a liability on your
          property. Leftover stumps in high-traffic areas can be a tripping
          concern. It can even attract unwanted critters such as beetles, ants,
          and termites. Eventually, these critters can move to other parts of
          your property, causing further headaches. Removing your stumps cleans
          your yard and offers new space for better things to grow. Call us
          today for a tree removal service in Fort Collins.
